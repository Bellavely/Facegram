Read Me :
for running the project (i got a bug in my commands ) use java extention for visual studio code.
and you need to install jdk because java uses jdk.

for each command in facegram i implemented the command design pattern it will be easier for maintance.
i have only part of the commands in my project and i didnt finished to implemnt them.

hashMap = for a faster access to my apps data for example in my user model or message model.

thoughts i had during the writing of the app:

- implement observer for the user feed because they always changes
- strategy for sorting the messages show them by time or show them by num likes
  create two diffrent classes for sorting the data.
